Operator tools, outside the TEE: `signer-admin` (drafts and signs setup updates and orders, `approver` and its agents), `cluster` (setups of a signer group), the admin client (`remote/admin`), and the key lifecycle tools: `share-import`, `setup-tool`, `identity-check` and `proof-check`. `fakerunner` is a test runner for the tools.

The runner checks everything these tools send; none of them holds a validator key.

`signer-admin exit` signs a voluntary exit. Only the admin role may sign one, so the signing client cannot. It sends the exit to the signers of `cluster.json` in turn with each signer's admin connection file, keeps the first t partial signatures that verify under their share keys (t and the share indices come from the split file of `import-draft`; a cluster of one single-mode signer needs none), combines them, checks the result under the validator key and writes the beacon API body. It posts nothing. To broadcast:

```
signer-admin exit -cluster cluster.json -split split.json -pubkey 0x... -index 123 -epoch 0 -out exit.json
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data @exit.json http://BEACON:5052/eth/v1/beacon/pool/voluntary_exits
```

Every setup file says `signing_mode`: `threshold` (the signers hold shares of t-of-n splits, n >= 2) or `single` (one signer holds whole keys). One key is held by one runner: `signer-admin setup` refuses `single` with more than one signer and `threshold` with one, every tool that reads `cluster.json` refuses a single-mode cluster of more than one signer, and `import-draft` refuses a split file that gives one share index to two signers, or a split that does not fit the target's mode, as its runner does. `signer-admin setup` refuses a single-mode file whose signer is on GCP: that signer would hold keys alone (1 of 1), which is unsafe there (Cloud KMS has no lock on the key release rule). `-allow-gcp-unsafe-single-key` accepts the risk in the setup of such a one-signer GCP file and prints a WARNING line (a threshold file, or a signer that is not on GCP, refuses the flag); so does the key `sealing_key_release.unsafe_single_key_accepted = true` in the signer's section, which `setup-tool encode` warns about too. On mainnet the setup also needs `sealing_key_release.no_lock_accepted = true`, or it is refused: without it the runner would not start. `signer-admin import-draft` refuses a `not_after` more than 7 days from now: a runner takes shares under an order until its `not_after`, so keep it short. It drafts a 1 of 1 order to a GCP signer only with `-allow-gcp-unsafe-single-key`, and `show` prints the warning to each approver. Why, and what it means: [platform-gcp/deploy/README.md](../platform-gcp/deploy/README.md#setup), "Setup".

Module path `github.com/lidofinance/tee-signer/signer-admin`, with its own `go.mod`. It uses other modules of this repo only through their public packages (`scripts/check-imports.sh`).

Test it on its own from the repo root: `scripts/test-modules.sh signer-admin`.
